# Event-Triggered Privacy Anchors (ETPA) for Federated Learning

## üìå Project Overview
This project implements **Federated Learning with Differential Privacy** using:
- **Privacy Anchors** (synthetic samples via DP-VAE / DP-GAN),
- **Event-Triggered Adaptation** (adjusting DP noise and regenerating anchors dynamically).

The goal is to balance **accuracy, privacy, and efficiency** in non-IID federated settings.
